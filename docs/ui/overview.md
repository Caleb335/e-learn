### User Interface

User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices, focusing on looks or style. Designers aim to create interfaces which users find easy to use and pleasurable. Examples are: voice-controlled interfaces. As a UI designer you’ll work very closely with UX designers, whose job typically consists of talking with customers to determine requirements, building user profiles and creating user stories to show how a user will work their way through your application.

User interface is important to meet user expectations and support the effective functionality of your site. A well-executed user interface facilitates effective interaction between the user and the program, app or machine through contrasting visuals, clean design and responsiveness. When designing a UI for your site, it's important to consider the user's expectations in terms of accessibility, visual aesthetic and ease of use. An optimal mix of effective visuals and efficient responsiveness will improve your site's conversion rates, as it anticipates the needs of the user and then satisfies those needs.

### User Experience

You can percept this by asking yourself these questions: Was it easy to navigate? Did I ever feel lost or confused? How did I know where to click to get to where you needed to go?

UX design is about having complete understanding of the user. UX designers will conduct intensive user research, craft user personas and conduct performance testing and usability testing to see which designs are most effective at getting a user to their end goal in the most delightful way possible. The UX designer wants the navigation of a site, the type of user interface or product feel completely intuitive so the user doesn’t feel confused or frustrated while trying to accomplish their goal.
