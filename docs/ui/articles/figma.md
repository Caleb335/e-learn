### 1. **Getting Started**

If you’ve ever wanted to pursue a career in design, learn the ins-and-outs of the design process, or just want to improve your relationships with the designers in your life, you’ve come to the right place [_Continue Learning..._](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/getting-started/)


### 2. **What is Graphic Design?**

A common misconception is that design is merely making things pretty. It’s true, there is an element of design that is purely aesthetics, but it’s not inclusive of everything that design is. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the things that design is [_Continue Learning..._](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/what-is-design/)

### 3. **Design Thinking & Ethics**

It’s tempting to create a new file and get started making something immediately, but there are some considerations to make before pixels hit the canvas. The reality as a designer is that moving pixels around on your screen is only a small part of your job. [_Continue Learning..._](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/ethics/)

### 4. **Accessibility and Inclusion**

Inclusivity is a design opportunity, and an essential part of the design process is ensuring we’re designing for more people than just ourselves. Inclusion starts with being aware of those that might have challenges accessing your app or use it differently, and extends all the way to you remaining cognizant of how your app portrays people. [_Continue Learning..._](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/inclusion/)

### 5. **Design Research**

Research is the stage of the design process when you are discovering problems that need solutions and customers that need helping. Your primary goal is to get an understanding of a group or groups of people’s problems. You will be investigating to understand your customers and the context of their situation, especially as it relates to their problems that you are attempting to solve or offer solutions for. [_Continue Learning..._](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/research/)

### 6. **Content**

As you’ll see when we dive into wireframing, there are benefits to starting with no content, or even fake content, and keeping only the customer experience and layout in mind. But, with this method, you’ll start to notice that your design mocks don’t match up to your finished app with real customer content in them. Lines of text might be longer than the space allotted to it in the design file [_Continue Learning..._](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/content/)

### 7. **Storytelling**

UX design, or User Experience design, focuses on the experience your customers have as they move through your product. This most commonly applies to digital design, but it is no different in concept than interior design, for example. How a customer enters, walks through, and leaves a business is the physical equivalent of the UX of your app or website. [_Continue Learning..._](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/storytelling/)

### 8. **Simplicity**

One of the key elements to consider when designing is simplicity. As you are addressing a problem, simplifying the customer’s experience is essential. Simplicity in design can reduce the level that your customers may be intimidated by it. This is especially the case with technology products or services that handle health, money, or long-term decision making, where your customers may already be experiencing stress.[_Continue Learning..._](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/simplicity/)

### 9. **Consistency**

Building and maintaining a consistent experience in your designs, products, and systems can have great consequences for your customers and their experience. Customers become accustomed to specific interface objects and even the location of those objects on a screen. This makes the experience familiar, and your product becomes more straightforward to use.[_Continue Learning..._](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/consistency/)

### 10. **Constraints**

Constraints are limitations on the designs and products you create or the processes you use while making them. They can significantly help you develop ideas — and they come from customers, stakeholders, or are even self-imposed. Within these limitations, it’s possible to be inspired to find great ideas or solutions; to narrow the possibilities for entry points into the design process while allowing for the quicker production of work with fewer options. [_Continue Learning..._](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/constraints/)

### 11. **Hierarchy**

Hierarchy is the organization or presentation of elements in a way that suggests importance. The arrangement and emphasis of visible elements influence the order in which the human eye perceives what it is seeing. This order of dominance is created by the visual contrast between objects and the principles of Gestalt philosophy. [_Continue Learning..._](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/hierarchy/)

### 12. **Typography**

Working with type can be intimidating, with tons of choices, potential use cases, and terminology rooted in the print industry. If you are coming to design from anywhere but a printing studio it can be hard to catch up quick. This is an introduction to the typefaces, color contrast, alignment, readability, text hierarchy, and more, that you can use to start laying out type successfully.
