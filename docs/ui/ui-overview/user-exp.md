### User Experience

UX design is the process of enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the user and the product. You can percept this by asking yourself these questions: Was it easy to navigate? Did I ever feel lost or confused? How did I know where to click to get to where you needed to go?

UX design is about having complete understanding of the user. UX designers will conduct intensive user research, craft user personas and conduct performance testing and usability testing to see which designs are most effective at getting a user to their end goal in the most delightful way possible. The UX designer wants the navigation of a site, the type of user interface or product feel completely intuitive so the user doesnâ€™t feel confused or frustrated while trying to accomplish their goal.
