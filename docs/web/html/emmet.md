### Using Emmet to write markup faster

Emmet abbreviation and snippet expansions are enabled by default in _html_, _haml_, _pug_, _slim_, _jsx_, _xml_, _xsl_, _css_ and stylus files, as well as any language that inherits from any of the above like handlebars and php.

When you start typing an Emmet abbreviation, you will see the abbreviation displayed in the suggestion list. If you have the suggestion documentation fly-out open, you will see a preview of the expansion as you type. If you are in a stylesheet file, the expanded abbreviation shows up in the suggestion list sorted among the other CSS suggestions.
