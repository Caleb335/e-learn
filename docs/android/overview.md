### Overview

Mobile app development is the creation of software intended to run on mobile devices and optimized to take advantage of those products' unique features and hardware. The types of mobile apps that developers create include native apps, hybrid apps and HTML5 apps. The creation of mobile applications has much of its roots in traditional software development. The end result, however, is software intended to utilize the unique features and hardware of mobile devices. Modern smartphones are equipped with Bluetooth, NFC, gyroscopic sensors, GPS and cameras. They can be used for virtual or augmented reality, barcode scanning, and more. Mobile apps should utilize the full range of smartphone features, which is easier said than done.

### Classification of mobile applications

1. **Native apps**
   These are apps created for a specific platform (iOS or Android) using the software development tools and languages supported by those operating systems. iOS uses Xcode and Objective-C, whereas Android uses Eclipse and Java. Developers often prefer native apps because of their ability to utilize a device's full potential. With smart home devices becoming more common, developers are creating unique applications that integrate things like wearables, Internet of Things sensors and smart screens for personalized experiences.

2. **HTML5 apps**
   Based on the near-universal standards of web technologies – HTML5, JavaScript and CSS – this type of mobile app takes a write-once-run-anywhere approach to mobile development. Apps developed in this framework are compatible with many platforms and require only minimal changes to ensure complete functionality on each operating system. HTML5 apps can still send desktop notifications and trigger interactions through email and other avenues. Despite its advantages, native apps are still preferred to HTML5 apps
3. **Hybrid apps**
   These apps entail the creation of a container developed in the native system that makes it possible to embed an HTML5 app within it. This allows apps to make use of the diverse and unique elements of each native system. Before creating your own branded app, consider utilizing existing apps for greater impact. For example, by using mobile-focused marketing on services such as Yelp, Facebook and Google Maps, you can drive traffic to both your website and brick-and-mortar location.

### Languages used to develop mobile apps

Over the years, a number of languages are used for mobile app development and there has been reduction in complexity of these languages. Some of them are:

- JavaScript
- Kotlin
- C++
- C#
- Python
- PHP
- Swift
- Objective-C
